you, even,though you don't think it does.,But you're so scared, Sam,,that you'd rather,make yourself sick,than be around for the next,50 years of being alone.,I mean, you're standing,in a country store,in the middle of nowhere,screaming about a girl,who left you 10 years,ago and she's moved on.,Right or wrong, Sam, she's gone,and she is never coming,back and she doesn't care,,about you, about

know.,- Well because you,don't ultimately,want to take responsibility,for your actions.,Hm?,The big victim can just,blow his brains out,and be done with it.,But the man who goes,to those he's wronged,and asks forgiveness,,not just repents,,but asks them for a gift,,allows them to be holy,,to act out in faith, to,exercise their gift from God.,Now until you offer,them that opportunity,,by asking them for forgiveness,,you are never going,to get over this.,- Hi.,Hey.,Hi, I'm Manny.,- Hi Manny.,Jody.,- So this is where you play?,- Yeah, this is where I play.,- You like playing here?,- Um,

Astérix and Obélix: God Save Britannia (2012) - full transcript,"The year is 50 B.C. Caesar is hungry for new conquests. At the head of his glorious legions he decides to invade the island that lies at the very edge of the known world, that mysterious land known as Britain. Victory is swift and total. Or - almost. One single tiny village manages to resist, but its forces are growing weaker so Corddlia, Queen of the Britons, decides to send her most faithful officer Jolitorax to seek aid in Gaul, in another small village famed for its dogged resistance to the Romans. At the village in question, Astérix and Obélix already have their hands full. Their chief has entrusted them with the task of making a man of Goudurix, his young pain in the ass nephew recently arrived from Lutèce. And their task is far from accomplished. When Jolitorax arrives to ask for help, the Gauls decide to give him a barrel of their famous magic potion. Astérix and Obélix will accompany him back to Britain - as will Goudurix. After all, the voyage seems to offer an excellent opportunity for completing the young man's education. Unfortunately, nothing ever goes quite to plan.","ASTERIX & OBELIX,IN BRITAIN,We've been through hard times.,We've often believed,,and then had to unbelieve.,Can you say that?,But today,,we're on an even keel.,Believe me,,we're going to recover our losses!,Ship to starboard!,Ship to starboard!,Up and at 'em!,What did I tell you?,Over here, my dears.,What the...,At your stations!,Raise the sails!,Get your oars out!,Hurry!,Too late.,Up and at 'em!,Can anyone tell me what that was?,This my friends, this majestic sight,,is the most powerful army,that's ever existed.,It carries Rome's name,to the frontiers of the known world.,At its head,is one man.,A supreme leader.,A warrior who conquered Helvetia,,drove back the Germans,,crushed the Gauls,,and who will now conquer an island,called Britannia.,Britain!,This conquest, my friends,,is not merely one more laurel,in Caesar's crown.,This conquest,is the gift of the Roman people,to Britain's natives.,A barbarian people,who dwell in ignorance,,to whom we will bring,the benefits of Western civilisation.,By golly, this is a jolly rum thing,,eh what?,I say, rather, old fruit.,Britain is inhabited,by a mysterious people,who have one very curious custom:,at five in the afternoon,,everything comes to a halt.,Push!

The Doctor's.,And who, in a lovely anonymous letter,,I'm used to them,,makes this revelation?,Someone we know to be very cowardly,,and who is afraid.,Namely, the exporter.,The exporter, who you delightfully,call the Honorable Tradesman,,is strangled.,It's the ultimate proof,against the Doctor.,Knowing the game is up,,the Doctor takes revenge.,Or that's what I'm supposed to believe.,It's as easy as two and two...,All I have to do is arrest the Doctor,,half my work's been done for me.,In a few months,,the Doctor will be sentenced.,Thanks to Perceval, no more Doctor.,The perfect crime.,Half my work had been done for me,,but a mistake was made.,Because I'd read,a detective novel or two.,Lend them to me.,So I'd ruled out the guiltiest one.,There were only three of you left.,- And Miss Lotte.,- Finally.,Good evening, Miss Lotte.,Of those three,,the guiltiest was innocent.,Ruled out.,Of the two remaining, I was to disregard,the guiltiest and arrest the other.,Which is what I'm going to do.,You're beautiful.,- You think so?,- I believe everything I say.,- Sorry, where was I?,- You...,Please, do you mind?,The Doctor, therefore,,being the guiltiest, was excluded.,- Ruled out.,- Rejected, thrown out...,...discarded. You can't fool me.,Who's next?,- Miss Lotte.,- Staring you in the face.,Yes, the photograph.,The Doctor's accomplice.,Accomplice to an innocent man,,therefore innocent.,Can I take notes?,It's rather spurious, but...,Sniggering, I continue.,The Honorable Tradesman.,But here, I pause for a moment.,Go ahead.

Eye of the Tiger (1986) - full transcript,"Buck Matthews (Gary Busey) is a former Vietnam veteran/ex-con recently released from the state prison. He returns to the small Midwest town where he grew up only to discover the place overrun by a large motorcycle gang bent on causing trouble. When the bikers murder his wife and traumatize his young daughter, Buck finds himself all alone. The corrupt town sheriff (Seymour Cassel) is unsympathetic and unwilling to help Buck (because the sheriff is under control of the biker gang leader Blade (William Smith). So, Buck decides to take matters into his own hands, With the help from a fellow Vietnam vet, Deputy J.B. Deveraux (Yaphet Kotto), as well as Buck's former cell-mate, a drug kingpin living in Miami, Buck arms himself to the teeth and wages a one-man war against the motorcyclists to destroy them once and for all.","23.976 English,Yeah!

Strafsache 4 Ks 2/63 - Auschwitz vor dem Frankfurter Schwurgericht (1993) - full transcript,"The movie covers the trial, which took almost two years, in a court in Frankfurt of the men who ran Auschwitz. Frankly, many long segments of it are boring. Some are very moving.In covering its subject, the movie also reviews the whole gamut of the 12-year ""1,000-year Reich,"" even the trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann.Perhaps because there were no survivors, the film does not cover the abuse of Soviet prisoners of war in Auschwitz, especially the horrible medical experiments that they were subjected to (I recall one from another source in which two Russians were submerged in ice water, either to see how long it would take them to die, or to see whether they could be resuscitated by being placed between two naked women).But the movie concentrates on the murder of Jewish children, while the accused denied all.","[police siren],[narrator] Frankfurt, 1964.,In these prison vans,are accountants,,businessmen and pharmacists.,They're accused,of many thousands of murders,,committed in Auschwitz,concentration camp.,The biggest trial,in German legal history,is taking place in Frankfurt.,The matter before the court,is the state's genocide,of the European Jews.,Twenty-two Holocaust,perpetrators,have to face their judges.,[birds chirping],[mysterious music],[crowd murmuring],Auschwitz-Birkenau,,a marshy district,on the River Vistula in Poland.,From 1941 on,,a few thousand SS men,implemented a secret German,government project here:,state-ordained mass murder.,They killed more,than a million people.,[train braking and whistling],Day and night,the German railways,deported European Jews,from the countries occupied,by the Wehrmacht,to the concentration camps,in the east.,Tens of thousands died,even before the journey ended.,And journey's end,was Auschwitz-Birkenau.,SS doctors selected,those Jews capable of working,they were sent to the camp,,the others were gassed,right away.,One SS man took these pictures.,They were submitted,to the court as evidence.,So was this Soviet film footage.,[silence],The chief state prosecutor,in Hesse,,Fritz Bauer,,had been working,on the Auschwitz case,since the mid-fifties.,He inaugurated a process,that encompassed,the entire complex of crimes.,Bauer,,himself a victim of Nazism,,wanted a German court,to uncover the entire truth,about Auschwitz.,He wanted the Germans,to be aware,of their responsibility,for the genocide.,[silence],The press conference,before the start of the trial:,The Auschwitz trial,is to show us Germans,in Germany,,but also the world,,that a new Germany,,a new German democracy,,is willing to uphold the dignity,of every human being.,This trial is less,about looking backwards,and more about setting,the tone for the future.,[narrator] The twentieth,of December 1963.,A Christmas market in Frankfurt.,Much was forgotten,eighteen years,after the end of the war.,People looked,after their families,,their careers, their savings.,Few knew,what had actually happened,in Auschwitz.,That was about to change.,A trial was to start,in Frankfurt,that would confront the Germans,with their past.,While the world,was eagerly awaiting this trial,,the Germans didn't pay,much attention.,[crowd talking],There was neither resistance,nor enthusiasm.,Life in Germany just plodded on.,[jazz music],[narrator] Escapism after work,,daydreaming at the bar.,In the country,of the economic miracle,,the entertainment industry,came up,with suitable illusions.,[jazz music continues],The trial was a signal,that the German people,would be confronted,with what had happened,a few years earlier.,It hadn't been that long ago.,[narrator] On the twentieth,of December 1963,,Hans Hofmeyer stepped up,to the bench.,The trial was formally opened.,Four of the 22 defendants,were about to make,the headlines.,Wilhelm Boger,,an interrogation expert,for the Gestapo in the camp.,Josef Klehr, a paramedic,and disinfector.,Victor Capesius,,the camp pharmacist in charge,of the Zyklon B.,And the main defendant,Robert Mulka.,A former member,of the Freikorps,,a right-wing paramilitary group,,he'd been discharged,from the regular army,,accused of embezzlement.,He joined the SS.,He knew Rudolf Höss,,the camp commandant,in Auschwitz,,from his time in the Freikorps.,Höss made him his adjutant.,In 1946 Höss was arrested,by the British military police,and handed over to the Poles.,Convicted and sentenced,by a Polish court,,he was executed in Auschwitz.,Mulka, his adjutant,,was arrested as a wealthy,businessman in Hamburg.,He was able,to stay out of prison,after putting up bail,of fifty thousand Deutschmarks.,[mysterious music],Public prosecutor Joachim Kügler,discovered Mulka by chance.,Frankfurt's public prosecutors,had spent years,looking all around the world,for the perpetrators,of Auschwitz.,They followed hundreds of leads,,mostly to no avail.,[mysterious music],Mulka was found when his son,won an Olympic medal in Rome.,[Joachim Krüger],When I arrested him,,he tried to play the reputable,businessman from Hamburg.,He said at the start,of the trial,that he had been a soldier.,[clearing throat],He wanted the court,to treat him like a soldier,who had done his duty.,I stood up in the courtroom,and told him,and all the participants,that he wasn't a soldier,,but a member,of a uniformed death squad.,[narrator] As adjutant,,SS-Hauptsturmführer Mulka,was the head,of the uniformed death squad,,which was called in,for special purposes.,His three thousand SS men,kept the Auschwitz,killing factory going.,A band of men, brutal to others,,brothers to each other.,Their camaraderie held up,during the trial too.,[silence],The public prosecutors submitted,this document,from Auschwitz as evidence.,It proves Mulka's appointment,as the second-most powerful man,in the camp.,All the organizational matters,went through him...,including this special order,issued by camp commandant Höss.,To avoid personal harm,,the SS men were only,to enter the gas chambers,five hours,after the gassing took place.,Mulka's signature,on this document,proves that he knew,about the gassing.,Mulka was also responsible,for acquiring the Zyklon B,and for transporting,the victims to the gas chambers.,[crowd murmuring],The trial was now,on the public radar,,providing fodder,for the tabloids.,Mulka put Auschwitz,in the headlines.,In April, the court moved,to different premises.,[crowd murmuring],The new courtroom,provided more space,for the growing number,of spectators,,including many school parties.,[suspenseful music],This is an exact replica,of that court room.,Filming was not permitted during,the trial.,But the court made,an audio recording,,which also includes,Mulka being interrogated,by prosecutor Kügler.,[crowd murmuring],[Kügler] I ask you now,,did you know,that the people in the lorries,were heading,to the gas chambers?,[Mulka] I was not aware of that.,[Kügler] How do you explain,that this was kept from you,and that you're only finding out,today?,[Mulka] There was no reason,to tell me,because I had nothing to do,with the prison camp,and inmates.,[Kügler] You're trying to say,that when you were adjutant,,you didn't know,that the lorries were used,to drive those destined,to be gassed,to the gas chambers?,[Mulka] I wasn't asked about it.,[Kügler] You mean,you didn't know?,[Mulka] I didn't know!,[narrator] That was the tactic,of all the accused.,Mulka's lies made the headlines.,Witness Josef Glück,couldn't believe it.,[Josef Glück] I read,in the papers,that the men say,they didn't know,what was going on in Auschwitz.,Let me tell you,that I already knew everything,on the second day I was there.,But not just me.,This young lad, who was sixteen,,Andreas Rappaport,,he wrote with blood:,Andreas Rappaport,,lived for sixteen years.,He called to me:,'Uncle, I know I have to die!,Tell my mother I thought,of her till the end.',This young lad,knew what was going on,and these men didn't?,[silence],[narrator] A lot of witnesses,spoke for the first time,about their time in the camp.,Hermann Langbein was responsible,for getting more,than two hundred survivors,to Frankfurt.,They trusted him.,He too had been an inmate,and for many years,the secretary general,of the International,Auschwitz Committee.,The hearing of witnesses began,in February 1964.,Frankfurt Central Station became,the hub,for all the Auschwitz survivors,from around the world.,They came from Israel, Poland,,Canada, the United States,,Czechoslovakia,and the Soviet Union.,They all felt uneasy,about setting foot,on German soil again,,reading German words,and hearing German announcements,on the loudspeakers.,Hermann Langbein suffered,with the witnesses.,[Hermann] For many people,from other countries,,German was the language,of the enemy.,And when they heard German,,their first reaction,was to think that they were,in the presence of someone,who had done these things,to them.,That may not sound nice today,,but it was the reality.,Now you had these witnesses,who didn't know where to sleep,or where the courtroom was.,They couldn't take a taxi,because they couldn't pay,for it.,It was an intolerable situation.,[narrator] The Jewish doctor,Mauritius Berner,,who now lived in Israel,,came as a witness to Frankfurt.,His wife and three children,had been murdered in Auschwitz.,On the way to the stand,he had to reckon,with confronting,the perpetrators of Auschwitz.,Several of the accused,weren't yet under lock and key,and strolled casually,to the court as a group.,[car horns],The SS dentist Doctor Schatz,was also still free.,He affably greeted,the court security guard,,who stood to attention,and saluted him.,The many witnesses,that were called.,And not all of them came,,because they had no trust,in Germany.,Were put up in hotels,and the accused were,in the same hotels.,The chief defendant,,Robert Mulka,,the adjutant,of the camp commandant,,was sitting having breakfast,with them.,I mean!,I never understood that people,,Germans,,who had also been through a lot,,could permit that.,Private individuals,,such as Mrs. Bonhoeffer,,came and looked after them.,How many witnesses,broke down crying,after leaving the witness stand,because of having had to talk,about their experiences?,[narrator] The duty to speak out,for the dead,was also what made,Doctor Mauritius Berner,take the stand.,He told the story of his family,that came on one,of the trains from Transylvania.,[Mauritius] We quickly,put our wives and children,in their coats and got out.,We were immediately confronted,with an awful sight.,[narrator] Dr. Berner,and his family,arrived in Auschwitz,in the summer of 1944,,during the Hungarian transports.,The railways brought,ten thousand people,to the gas chambers every day.,The court had these photographs,of the murder,of the Hungarian Jews,as evidence.,Doctor Berner,had an unexpected encounter,on the overcrowded platform.,[silence],[Mauricius Berner] Two German,officers came up to us.,One of them was a tall,,handsome man.,I later found out,that this was Dr. Mengele.,Much to our surprise,there was an old acquaintance,next to him,,Doctor Victor Capesius,,whom we knew from Transylvania.,He'd worked for IG Farben,and had visited us doctors two,or three times a year.,[narrator] Dr. Berner still had,the business card,of the IG Farben representative.,He gave it to the court.,[car horns],Up until his arrest,,Capesius lived an affluent life,as the owner of a pharmacy,in Göppingen near Stuttgart.,The man who had been,in charge of the Zyklon B,was now in cosmetics.,As the camp pharmacist,,he gave Dr. Berner hope,on the arrival platform,in Auschwitz.,A thought popped into my mind,and I said to Dr. Capesius:,I have twins,,who need protection.,I'll work as you wish,in return for staying,with my family.,He said:,'Twins? Where are they?',I said: 'There!',He said: 'Call them back.',I called my wife and children.,They turned around,and I indicated they were,to come back.,Dr. Capesius took my twins,by the hand,and took them to Dr. Mengele.,He told me: 'Tell him'.,I started to,but he dismissed me,,telling me he didn't have time,right now.,Dr. Capesius sent them back,to the row,where I had called them from.,I started crying,but Dr. Capesius said to me,in Hungarian:,'Don't cry,,they're just going for a wash'.,'You'll see them again,in an hour.',I'm still calling,after my wife and children.,I never saw them again.,[silence],[narrator] An SS photograph,used as evidence by the court:,the morning roll call,in the women's camp,,the inmates before leaving,for their workplaces.,There are clearly adolescents,in the group.,They had to be at least fourteen,to be picked for the camp,,rather than the gas chamber.,They were often forced,to do awful things.,[silence],One of these teenagers,was Yehuda Bacon.,He was deported,from Czechoslovakia,together with his parents,,siblings and relatives in 1943.,He was fourteen at the time.,He's the only one who survived.,Yehuda Bacon is now,an art professor in Jerusalem.,On the stand,,he described the work,the children had to do.,[Yehuda] There was a cart,and it wasn't drawn by horses,,but by around twenty teenagers.,We took this cart,to all the camps,and loaded it up.,One of the jobs,was to take the ash,from Crematorium number three,and scatter it on the icy paths,in the women's camp B2C.,Sometimes when we were finished,with the work,and the overseer was,in a good mood,,he said, Children,,there's no one,in the gas chambers right now.,You can go in there and warm up.,I, as a potential artist,,tried to memorize exactly,what they looked like.,As soon as the war was over,,I did these drawings.,I think they were shown during,the Auschwitz trial.,That's the disrobing chamber,and that's the gas chamber.,This is the shower-head.,That interested me,because there were,no real holes.,There were big fans,and a big shaft.,The Zyklon B was thrown in,from above.,This was the disrobing chamber.,The people had,to take their clothes off.,The SS man told them:,Remember your number,and hurry up,,the coffee's waiting.,[wind blowing],[narrator] On the thirteenth,of December 1964,something unimaginable happened.,In the middle of the Cold War,a delegation,from the court in Frankfurt,,headed,by associate judge Walter Hotz,,flew to Auschwitz.,There were,no diplomatic relations,between Poland,and West Germany at the time.,Auschwitz was a huge camp system,that extended,for forty square kilometers.,At the center were former,Polish army barracks,,then the seat,of the camp administration,and the SS guards.,When the camp system,was extended,,it was renamed,Stammlager Auschwitz I.,More than two hundred,journalists,from around the world attended.,On the fourteenth,of December 1964,the Frankfurt delegation,set foot in the camp.,The group wasn't just made up,of judges,and public prosecutors,,but also of eleven defendants.,And of the representatives,of the victims,,Henry Ormond,and Christian Raabe.,Herr Ormond,and I submitted an application,that the court make a visual,inspection of Auschwitz,,the crime scene.,We had to state exactly,what was to be proved,as a result.,Lots of questions came up,during the trial,where many said,in their defense,that they hadn't been able,to see something,or that something,the witness had described,hadn't been possible.,All of these things were,to be investigated,during the visual inspection.,A lot of things,could be cleared up,and refuted that way.,[suspenseful music],[narrator] One thing,that was cleared up,was what could be seen,from where in Block Eleven.,Mass executions took place,at the 'Black Wall',in the courtyard of this block.,Tens of thousands,were killed here,by being shot in the back,of the neck.,It was found,that this could be seen,from Block Eleven.,That confirmed important,witness statements.,[suspenseful music],This visual inspection was,a turning point in the trial.,Up until then more,than 250 witnesses,had testified in Frankfurt,,but the only image,the court managed,to create of Auschwitz,was based purely on words.,Much remained unclear.,It wasn't,until the confrontation,with the reality in the camp,that all the participants,became fully aware,of the monstrous dimensions.,Auschwitz was a death factory.,[suspenseful music continues],Chief defendant Mulka,had his office,in the commandant's,headquarters,in Stammlager Auschwitz I.,When he looked out,of the window,,he would see the gas chamber,and crematorium.,There's no way,he couldn't have known,about what went on there.,There's a shaft,on the roof of the bunker,through which the Zyklon B,poison gas pellets were poured.,The gas chamber lay below.,Next to the gas chamber,were the ovens,in which the victims,could be burned without delay.,The killing took place,with the poison gas Zyklon B,,a pesticide produced by Degesch,,a company owned in equal measure,by Degussa and IG Farben.,The headquarters of IG Farben,,the largest chemical company,in the world at the time,,were in Frankfurt.,The construction,of a huge factory,in Monowitz near Auschwitz,was planned.,It was to manufacture,synthetic rubber,and synthetic fuel,for the arms industry.,In July 1942,the head of the SS,,Heinrich Himmler,,visited the building site.,The SS was in business,with IG Farben,and provided the company,with inmates as laborers.,The Frankfurt court,spent three days,exploring Auschwitz.,All the camps and extermination,sites were visited.,The final appointment,was in the possessions store.,[crowd murmuring],The delegation saw,a huge warehouse:,everything the deported,and killed had on them,was sorted,,catalogued and stored.,[crowd murmuring],The defendants,were very impressed,with what they saw,,particularly,with what the Auschwitz Museum,had compiled.,There were mountains of glasses,,shoes, suitcases,and other items.,In retrospect,,I regretted,that not everyone in court,and not all the defendants,were required to see that.,[silence],[narrator] The extracted,gold teeth of the dead,were particularly sought,after by the SS men.,Witness Rudolf Vrba,came to Frankfurt from London.,He'd managed to escape in 1944.,He informed governments,,the Vatican,and the world public at the time,about the events occurring,in Auschwitz.,[lawyer] Mr Vrba,,what was your job,in the clean-up squad?,Our work started,the next morning.,The squad was marched,to the effects chambers.,The packages were ripped open,and everything was sorted.,Documents, personal photographs,,family albums,and the like were burned.,Shirts, jackets and so on,were carefully sorted according,to their quality,,as were women's blouses.,The valuables were taken away,in suitcases.,There was a suitcase full,of dollars,,pounds sterling, reichsmarks,,zloty, gold watches,and things like that.,The people were burned,,killed and burned.,The suitcases weren't killed,or burned.,They were treated,very carefully.,I had to ask myself:,where are all their,other things?,They weren't the poorest,in Europe.,They had shops, houses,,fields, cars, bicycles,,radios, furniture.,What happened to all the things,they hadn't brought with them?,There can be a big discussion,about whether it was six,or seven million Jews,that were killed,,but I can tell you for certain,that not a single one,was murdered,without also having,been robbed. Not one.,[narrator] The raid,of the Nazi state,on the possessions,of the European Jews,was a taboo subject during,the post-war era.,When the chimneys,were smoking again,and the factories were working,at full capacity,and the economic miracle,was in full swing,,nobody asked anymore,what had happened,to their billions.,Too many Germans had had,their piece of the pie.,This goal,of the extermination policy,was also raised,in court in Frankfurt.,The press started picking up,on issues like this.,The literary elite were,to be found in the foyer,of the courtroom.,The New York Times sent,the famous dramatist,and husband of Marilyn Monroe,,Arthur Miller, to Frankfurt.,[crowd talking],This reporting had an impact.,I don't know how long,that lasted.,But they were outraged,about what they heard and read.,There were many,who didn't believe it,,but they couldn't refute it.,There were new revelations,every day.,I liked hearing,Axel Eggebrecht's reports.,We sometimes sat together,and wrote these reports,in the evening,and afterwards we got drunk.,Because, who can bear it?,Even if you only have,to write it down.,[narrator] People were horrified,by the reports,about the Boger swing,,an instrument of torture,where the shackled victims,hung over an iron bar,with the backs of their knees,,while they were beaten,in the abdomen.,[silence],Boger was notorious,for such torture.,His job in the Gestapo,was to prevent inmates,from escaping,or putting up resistance.,His office was in the barracks,right next to the crematorium.,That's where,the torture took place.,Women from the camp,acted as secretaries.,You can imagine that I saw,a lot of awful things.,The interrogations were,with inmates,who had fled,and been recaptured.,The Gestapo from Katowice,sent hostages from the prisons,or others who were suspected,of having worked,in the resistance movement.,They were often shackled,to the swing to make them talk.,It was an instrument of torture,that Boger had invented.,I saw the inmates before,and after.,They were almost unrecognizable.,Two days later I often got,the document confirming,their death.,[silence],[narrator] Boger,,the former police commissioner,,enjoyed the torture.,In the camp he was called,'the devil of Auschwitz'.,[silence continues],After the war, Boger lived,in Hemmingen near Stuttgart.,He worked as an accountant,and was a respected citizen.,After his arrest,,a reporter interviewed his wife.,[reporter] Were you in Auschwitz,together with your husband?,Yes.,[reporter] How do you judge,the things your husband,is now being accused of?,I can't imagine,that he did all of that.,My husband was very precise,,but I can't imagine,that he murdered children,and then just came home.,We had children ourselves,and he was a very good father.,[crowd murmuring],[narrator] The court,had now been in session,for eleven months.,[crowd murmuring],Then Erna Krafft,from Aurich took the stand.,She came to Auschwitz,because she refused to work,in a munitions factory,in Dortmund.,Once in the camp,,Boger got his hands on her.,There are moments,when you don't care at all.,Suddenly Boger stood up,after this long interrogation,and pulled out a whip,from under his desk.,He came towards me slowly.,I was standing by the door.,He kept cracking the whip hard,in front of my face.,Then he whipped me twice,across the face.,Any surviving inmates,from Birkenau,will confirm,that when I returned,,I was unrecognizable.,If Mr. Boger is in the room,and if he should be released,and I'm alive,,I'll whip him like,that in return.,[man] Defendant, Mr. Boger,,rise.,I would like to ask Mr. Boger,whether he has anything,to say to us,in light,of this terrible account.,[Boger] No,,I have nothing to say.,[crowd murmuring],[narrator] One of the people,sitting in on the trial,was Frankfurt-based lawyer,Manfred Amend,,a close confidant,of Fritz Bauer.,The things that came,to light were awful.,It wasn't,a place where you wanted to be.,Fritz Bauer told me,that he hadn't been able,to sleep a single night,without sleeping pills,since the start,of the Auschwitz trial.,In one speech I heard him make,,he started his account with:,I've come from hell.,[sighs],[birds chirping],[narrator] Block 20,of the Stammlager,housed the inmate hospital.,This is where,the SS paramedics worked.,Inmates infected with malaria,and typhus were brought here.,If more beds were needed,,the weakest were identified,and killed.,The paramedic responsible,for clearing the beds,was SS-Oberscharführer,Josef Klehr,,a trained carpenter,,who joined the SS in 1932.,[silence],The Czech witness Imre Gönczi,,who was a nurse in the hospital,while he was imprisoned,in the camp,,explained how Klehr,killed people.,The patients got undressed,in this small room.,We had,to write their prisoner number,on their chest in blue ink.,I had to take them down,a corridor to the lab.,There was a table,between two windows,and the SS man Klehr,stood next to the table.,A chair was prepared,and another inmate,who was working there,sat my patient down.,The SS man Klehr,dressed in white like a doctor,went over to the patient,while the other inmate held him,and injected him straight,into the heart.,He was dead immediately.,Then we took him,into the neighboring room,,a bathroom,,and laid him on the floor.,I had to be there.,And the SS man Klehr,killed them all by injection.,[narrator] Each one,of these murders,was recorded,in Auschwitz's register office.,The cause of death,is listed as heart failure.,The court had some,of these death registers,as evidence.,For a 183 days,the accused SS men had to listen,to the Auschwitz,witness accounts.,Their deeds caused an outrage,around the world.,Not once did they,express any remorse.,On the nineteenth,of August 1965,,the verdict was expected.,[crowd talking],The world was looking,to Frankfurt,with tense curiosity.,Long queues were forming,in the courthouse.,The courtroom was packed.,The presiding judge,Hans Hofmeyer,started reading the verdict,,a process,that would take two days.,The court has been,at pains to find the truth.,The length of the trial,and the amount of evidence,that was heard,confirm that finding the truth,was the focus of this trial.,But what was it really like,in Auschwitz?,Above the main entrance,stood the words,'Arbeit macht frei'.,But what it said invisibly,was 'Abandon hope,,all ye who enter here.',Hell started behind this gate.,Hell, that is inconceivable,to normal human minds.,There aren't the words,to describe it.,Physically and mentally broken,,robbed of their human dignity,,these victims,took their final breaths,in the gas chambers,of Birkenau.,Jews and Christians,,Poles and Germans,,Soviet prisoners of war,and gypsies,,people from all over Europe,,all of whom had a mother,and all of whom were human:,that was the Auschwitz,concentration camp.,[narrator] Of the 20 accused,,Robert Mulka was sentenced,to 14 years in prison.,He was released in 1968,on compassionate grounds,and died in 1969.,Victor Capesius was sentenced,to nine years,and died in 1985.,Wilhelm Boger got,a life sentence,and died in prison in 1977.,Josef Klehr was also sentenced,to life in prison.,He was released in 1988,and died shortly afterwards.,[mysterious music],Fifty years have passed,since Fritz Bauer brought,the Auschwitz case to court.,It was important,to punish the guilty,,but to reveal the truth,about Auschwitz,was yet more important.,[mysterious music],It will never be extinguished.,Like the memory,of the deported and murdered,on the countless memorial tiles,outside their former homes.,[mysterious music],But the file on Auschwitz,has not yet been closed.,SS guards,at the former extermination camp,are still living quiet lives,in many German towns.,[mysterious music continues],The Central Office,for the Investigation,of National Socialist Crimes,in Ludwigsburg,still has much work to do.,[mysterious music],Mountains,of documents are piling up,on the desk of public,prosecutor Kurt Schrimm.,If prima facie,a crime has been committed,,prosecutors they must prosecute.,Provided the legal time period,has not expired.,[narrator] His work led,to charges,against the Auschwitz,SS man Hans Lipschis,,who faces trial in Ellwangen.,Investigations are taking place,in the case,of a further 39 SS members.,The 1964 Frankfurt trial,left a deep mark,on German society.,And yet,there remains great unease.,The monstrosity of the crimes,exceeds all human imagination.,No court can do justice to that.,[helicopter turbine

At least three weeks.,[in Arabic] And I can't wait,for those days to pass fast,until the sterilization.,Then humidification processes are done.,Then we open the papyrus.,[snaps fingers],- [wind gusting],- [tools scraping],[suspenseful music playing],[in English] After almost nine months,,we are still working.,And with every passing day,,the conditions out in the desert,become more difficult for the team.,- [Wahba in Arabic] We keep going?,- We'll continue to work normally.,But if it starts getting too windy?,If it gets too dusty and we can't see,,we can't keep going.,[Sadeq] We can tolerate,the heat and the sun,,but the storm is very hard.,When the storm hits you,,you cannot even close your mouth.,[Hawass in English] We suffer a lot.,But at the end, the discovery,makes you forget any difficulties.,[metal squeaking],We found a shaft,with an unlooted burial chamber.,Ah, okay.,[in Arabic] Do you have a light?,[in English] It's huge.,There is a huge limestone sarcophagus,,perfectly sealed.,Imahu, ""the honored one."",""Under""...,Nebet Hut.,The word ""overseer,"" Imerah,,is only for high people.,This is the highest title.,Her name is Nebet Hut.,Inside here should be a lady.,[eerie music playing],[men speaking in Arabic],[Hawass] Push, push, push.,[metal and wood creaking],[stone creaking],Okay, silence! Silent!,[mysterious music plays],I need more space.,You are looking at a woman,dated back 4,300 years ago.,Over 1,000 years older than King Tut.,[panting softly],Beautiful.,[mysterious music playing],Beautifully mummified.,[man in Arabic] Oh God!,[Hawass in English],The color of the necklace,,green and blue.,Two pieces of a beautiful headrest.,Gold.,Gold.,I think this is maybe the best mummy,we found until now in this cemetery.,[sighs],It's very rare that,you can make a discovery like this.,[pleasant music playing],[men speaking in Arabic],[Hawass in English] Most of the beautiful,mummies are dated 3,000 years ago.,But this mummy is maybe the oldest,beautiful mummy ever found in Egypt.,In the Old Kingdom,,mummification was extremely rare.,Only a pharaoh or someone in his court,would have access to that technology.,Now, the most exciting thing,,this is the work we're going to continue.,Examining the mummy.,[in Arabic] Of course,,it's something amazing.,It's a great feeling.,I took samples,,being as careful as possible,to not destroy the mummy that's under me.,For example, I took samples of the linen,and also from a black substance,on the head,,and around the skull.,I need to know what they're made of.,We have the use of resin,for the mummification of the face.,In the Old Kingdom,,the resin was used very rarely,,which means she could be,part of the royal palace.,[Mohi] The mummy,we're seeing in front of us,is not your everyday mummy in Saqqara.,We usually see a shaft,,a shaft with bones.,But to see a mummy that's almost whole,,from the Old Kingdom,,this is obviously something extraordinary,from this period of time.,I've been working in Saqqara a long time.,I saw different mummies.,But this is the first time for me,to see a gilded cane next to one.,This would mean that this person,is very important and should be respected.,No ordinary person will carry a cane,with them that's coated with gold.,So this is clearly,a unique mummy from this period.,Every time we stand in front of a mummy,,the first thing that comes to mind,,""Who was that person?"",Was that an eminent person in society?,Would I have been able,to stand in front of him,,during his existence? In his period?,[dramatic music building],[Hawass in English] No one of the elite,will be buried in an isolated cemetery.,She cannot go alone to the afterlife.,She has to fly together,with a big soul, with a king.,And therefore,,I believe that we are going to discover,a big, large,,important pyramid for a king.,The Pyramid of Huni.,[wind gusting],Maybe I will fail.,But maybe I will find it.,We're still working.,[men speaking indistinctly],[speaks in Arabic],Okay.,- [in Arabic] Is this completely closed?,- Yes.,We uncovered 83 meters from it.,You will also see a step on top.,You will see it.,It supports the idea,of this being a pyramid.,[Hawass] What else could it be?,[sighs],[man] Eighty meters,,and this is the corner here.,[tense music playing],[Hawass in English] I'm looking for,the Pyramid of Huni.,Now, if I discover this pyramid,,maybe intact, then my dream became true.,And this is why this Huni,,who is very little known in history,,he will come back to be famous,in the history of Egypt.,The angle here is clear.,[both speaking in Arabic],[in Arabic] Great.,We will proceed with the work,,so all workers need to be here.,A team on this side here.,Clean and uncover this whole area here.,[man speaks in Arabic],[in English] We'll work,completely in this area now.,No more tombs, but we will go,to discover the new pyramid.,[man shouting in Arabic],Look at the size of this wall.,It's 83 meters long from here to there.,It's 100% the base of the pyramid,,or this could be,the enclosure wall of the pyramid.,Actually, we are going,to start the excavation,from this corner for about 20 meters,,until we can find,the length of the side also.,- [speaking in Arabic],- [dramatic music playing],[Hawass] We are looking,at the beginning of a discovery,of a new pyramid,for the first time at Saqqara.,- [speaking in Arabic],- [men talking excitedly],[dramatic music building],[music fades],[in Arabic] Until today,,we can't confirm that it is a pyramid,,so we are waiting to see,the other side of the wall,,- to see if it could be a pyramid or not.,- Mm.,[gentle music playing],What are you planning to do,in the site of Bubasteion?,It is a good timing,for the end of the season.,[in English] Very good...,Very good discovery to announce!,- What's the discovery?,- No, I'm not going to tell you.,I'll keep it secret.,[puffs],It's like...,[chuckles softly],Like the old days. [laughing],[speaks in Arabic],[in Arabic] Ah, Dr. Zahi,,remember the good old days.,[Hawass in English],Over the last four decades,,I have trained,an army of Egyptian archeologists.,They will go on even after I am long gone.,More than anything I have discovered,,that will be my legacy.,[music continues],I taught all my assistants,how to be a good archeologist.,But I'll never be able,to teach them the passion.,But I hope that one of them can find it.,[car horns honking],Wait.

I've proven it.,- Does this have something to,do with that toothpaste mess,in the bathroom?,- You're not listening to me.,I need to get back into the lab.,- Liam, if it was up to me,you'd never set foot in that lab again.,- Well then it's good it's not up to you.,And I do go back.

Yes?,- You want to explain what,you've dragged us down here,to see?,- Liam?,- Yes. It's a little technical. Garret?,- Yeah, sure, sure.,The laser cannon is aimed at,the electromagnetic field,,which is at the same resonance,as the cosmic background,radiation of the big bang,,which means that the laser will travel,from the very beginning of,time to the end and back again,and should reappear 15,seconds into the future.,- Time travel. He is,talking about time travel.,- What the hell is going on with you?,- Nothing is faster than light,,but by manipulating time we can send it,into the future or into the past.,Glasses, everyone.,- Bringing field coils up to speed.,Liam.,- Okay, do it.,- Initiating test sequence in 3, 2, 1.,Showtime.,- Congratulations, Liam.,- T plus thirteen,,fourteen,,fifteen.,- What you have just witnessed,is a beam of light being sent,15 seconds into the future.,Imagine a message being sent,weeks or months into the past.,Imagine a bullet hitting its,target fired by a soldier,who has not even been born.,That is the future.,We're going to need to,speed up the timetable,of the crewed project.,When can you be ready?,- I'd have to check the numbers.,- The appropriations,committee need to see results,,so our best bet is for a,projection into the past,to secure the funding.,- What if we're moving too quickly?,- Liam, I know this is your baby,,but if you can't provide,me with what I need...,- You'll find somebody who,can. I've heard it before.,- You are invaluable to this project,and I have believed in,you and supported you,when others didn't.,We're on the verge of a breakthrough here,and I'm not gonna lose out,to the Chinese or Americans,because you've got cold feet.,- What if it's not safe?,- If it was safe, defence,wouldn't be interested.,- No, I'm talking end,of the world not safe.,- What is there new data,I should be aware of?,- No. It's, it's just a feeling.,- I want a timeline for a test,,for a projection of a human into the past,on my desk tomorrow.,Bonus, if it comes from the future.,- Emma.,- Thank you.,- Emma.,- Do I know you?,- No. There's, there's no,reason that you should.,- But you know me.,- Yeah, we've met before.,You just don't remember it, yet.,I'm Liam.,- Liam, I don't think we're,supposed to talk to people,we don't know in a secure facility.,- I understand completely.,I just need your help.,- I'm a doctor.

We just spoke.,You got into the lift and I,tried to ask you the question.,- That was two weeks ago. Call medical.,- No. I need to go back.,- You need to rest.,- No, I went somewhere,that meant something.,There was, there was an old man,and he was near some stones,and there was a spiral,on one of the stones.,- Was that in a valley?,- Yes. Do you know it?,- No. No. I mean there's,lots of places like that.,I've called the medical team, Doctor.,- It was probably something you remember,from your childhood.,Or something you saw in a documentary,or jumbled up with your emotions.,- No, he showed it to me for a reason.,- Who showed it to you?,- The old man.,He said I needed to be there when it ends.,- When what ends?,- The world.,I think.,- He's hallucinating.,- I am not hallucinating.,I am remembering and I,need to go back right now.,- If you don't calm down,,you're going nowhere apart from hospital.,Tell me why you think you,need to go back right now.,- You think my brain is,just throwing images around,until they stick. Okay.,But I remember Carter saying,that there was gonna be a crew test.,Why would I risk my life,in coming here alone,if there was already gonna be a test?,- Are you saying that what happened to you,wasn't an accident?,- I don't know. Maybe.,But I won't know unless,I go back and find out.,- Absolutely not.,- Um.,- What?,- Th-this says that you were,gone for over three hours.,- How is that possible? It,was less than 30 seconds.,- What else did it record?,- It picked up a wifi signal.,Date and time.
